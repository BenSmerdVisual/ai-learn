**AWS Cloud QUest: Machine Learnin Island**
**Amazon SageMaker**

- cloud quest- build own learning path with specific things- networking, machine learning, s3 etc
- **Sagemaker**- machine learning process for AWS, giving resources to train models, fine-tune, dploy and maintaint
- **Sagemaker studip**- interface with access to all the ML models in AWS Sagemaker
- **Inference endpoint**- endpoint where the model gets trained to, so where it will be accessed for services to access the model with the pipeline
- **Temperature parameter**- higher usually means sort of creativity so the response wont be as specific, IMPORTANT for technical question/responses
- Maybe have lambda functions for the execution of the ML  model execution
- **Cloudfront**- CDN resource to host static websites
- **API Gateway**- creating API for backend services, any web service endpoints (lambda, ec2, cloud etc), good way o handle multiple requests and use of multiple resources
