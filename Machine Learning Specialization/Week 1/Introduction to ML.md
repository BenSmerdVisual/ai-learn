## What is machine learning
- Machines have ability to learn without being explicitly programmed
- **Supervised Learning**- Mainly used in the applicable ML in current world
	- Input to output mapping- X to Y mapping, or determining the output based on the input compared to  the key:value of the data in the dataset
	- Give the ML algorithm the right answers with labels as "correct" and then the ML will be able to determine what is right based on these labels. It can take in the input and check if it matches the labeled current data and then gives the output if it is correct or not
		- Give the ML many pictures of birds that are labeled as birds for the sample data, and then if you input the machine a picture of a dog it will identify it as not a bird so the output would be false, while if you then input a picture of a bird it will identify it as a bird as comapred to the sample photos nd ouput it as correct
	- **Regression**- predict nunmbers when there is an infintenly number of possible outputs- this is finding continous numbers based on the data- constantly finding currenyt house prices- trying to predict something when there are many continous outputs
	- **Classification**- find outcomes based on categories of certain data and being able to match up the input to the data categories and ouput the matching category- if it is something or not-something- predict something based on a number of outputs
- **Unsupervised Learning**- second most used after supervised 
	-  While supervised learns from labeled data that we have put in, unsupervised does not learn from any labels- rather the learning will find something interesting in the unlabeled data. Essentially WANTING the algorithm to find something itself, find patterns
	- **Clustering**- automatically places unlabelled data into clusters when it may find groups of data- the groups would be based on similarities for each node in that cluster- each cluster would be some sort of variance which would have multiple characteristics
	- Finding structure within the data itself, without any sort of labeling
