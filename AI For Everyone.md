# Week 1- Introduction
- **ANI**- Artificial narrow intelligence- doing one guided version of AI- smart speaker, self-driving, web search, AI in farming and factories- have one trick about it- one specific task
- **AGI**- Artifical General Intelligence- build AI to do anything a human can do and do more than what a human can do
- More progress in ANI, rather than AGI as nowhere even close to the AGI, but very good progress on ANI 
- **What AI can/cant do today**- It can find basic examples when presented the examples, but it cannot figure out context of the examples--- this is the main problem
- **Machine Learning**- 
	- **Supervised Learning**- input to output mappings of information- if its someting basic and straight forward to input of an email and output of if its spam (spam filtering) or an english to chinese language translator- anything that you can do within 1 second though can be automated
		- Training larger amounts of data to be able to get better performance results
		- Using the labeled data so then the labels are recognised through the patterns by their results and then the label could be returned as the output as it is determined by the value that you are seeking- the supervision is having the kay being a supervisor of the value
			- **Regression model**- Predicting a continous-valued output like a housing price of a suburb or value of a speicif currency (as these values are constantly changing)
			- **Classification model**- Trying to predict a discrete number of values- like if something is a specific image based on a set of given images (cat, dog, tiger) or if something is something or is-not something (is this email spam)
- **Data**- Using the datasets to be able to recognise patterns within data of integers and being able to label specific data to maybe an image or some sort of visualisation- kind of a key:value tag
	- **Acquiring the data**- can either manually get it and add in relationships and keys to each piece of data- but this is too laborsome. Can observe behaviours and store the data and try make predictions based on previous behaviours. Can download from websiutes/partnerships etc. 
	- **Data problems**- data integrity and missing values can cause problems, need to data clean
- **Terminology**- 
	- **Machine Learning**- Learns the input to output- usually software running a algorithm of machine learning. Gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed (software)
	- **Data Science**- Analyse the data set to come up with the insight to improve businesses decisions. Extracting knowledge and insights from data (power slides)
	- **Deep Learning**- Using the neural networks to take in different sets of data and able to make an output based on each of the input, the neural networks basically checks for many different conditions to be able to provide the best slution- basically one complex and large mathetmatical equation
- **AI in a company**- Using strategic data acquisition and data warehouses to be able to store all their data and make decision based on it.
	- **AI  Transformation for a company**-
		1. Execute pilot projects to gain momentum
		2. Build an in-housr AI team
		3. Provide broad AI training
		4. Develop and AI strategy
		5. INternal and external communcation
- **Deep learning**- taking in all the factors that the person is using to try find the answer and being able to compare them to find the best answer, when comparing large scale data variables against each other to find the answer--- from the input its finding the best way to find the most efficient ouput
	- **neural networks**- are kind of like nodes tha have a specific value that can be combined from previous nodes and previous etc unbtil they find the value for the output

## Week 2: Building AI Projects
- **Machine learning workflow**- 
	1. Collect data- gather relevant information for whatever the task is- speech recognition would be people speaking the words relevant to what speech it is using
	2. Train model- Mapping the input data to start being able to produce output, usually the output would start off bad but it will gradually get better as the reinforcement of incorrect answers will start to correct the mapping to the correct answers
	3. Deploy model- Ship the model to users, starts getting new data that may not be used to what the trained data was on, need to maintain by updating the new data models types
- **Data science workflow**-
	1. Collect data- need to get the relevant information
	2. Analyze the data- need to recognise patterns to see what can change the business logic and practices to ehance the profit potential- iterate the ideas to get good insights
	3. Suggest hypotheses/actions- incorporating the actions to see what happens and re-analyze the new data impact on the business and re-integrate changes
- **Job function needs ML**- THe data scienbce will be used to optomize the manufactiuring line and the ML will automate the visual inspection of a product that could be being created in a manufactoring line. The data science can regonise the patterns of what needs to change because of the patterns and the ML will then use the data to determine the data that can be beneficial to the company and the data that isnt beneficial to the company
- **Choosing an AI project**- AI cant do everything to make your business better only some things
	- **Brainstorming**- automating tasks, not jobs- figure out the main drivers of the business value- what are the main pain points of the business (some can be slved by AI some not)- can make progress without the big data
	- **due diligence**- makle sure the technologt is good enbough to do what desired and how much data is needed to create it. Need to see if the business costs arent too high and if can create most efficiency and will the AI system actually increase revenue or help the business
	- **Build vs Buy**- dont have to build everything can buy things to make it so much easier and efficient
- When creating the workflow of data, usually have the training set which will be a set of data based on what you want the ML model to start analysing and then you will have a test set which will be different data models to test out and see how accurate the model can be when providing an asnwer to the question for it
- **Machine Learning Tools**- 
	- **Research publications**- Arxiv
	- **Frameworks**- Pytorch, TensorFlow, HugginFace
