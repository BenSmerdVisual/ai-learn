# Week 1- Introduction
- **ANI**- Artificial narrow intelligence- doing one guided version of AI- smart speaker, self-driving, web search, AI in farming and factories- have one trick about it- one specific task
- **AGI**- Artifical General Intelligence- build AI to do anything a human can do and do more than what a human can do
- More progress in ANI, rather than AGI as nowhere even close to the AGI, but very good progress on ANI 
- **What AI can/cant do today**- It can find basic examples when presented the examples, but it cannot figure out context of the examples--- this is the main problem
- **Machine Learning**- 
	- **Supervised Learning**- input to output mappings of information- if its someting basic and straight forward to input of an email and output of if its spam (spam filtering) or an english to chinese language translator- anything that you can do within 1 second though can be automated
		- Training larger amounts of data to be able to get better performance results
		- Using the labeled data so then the labels are recognised through the patterns by their results and then the label could be returned as the output as it is determined by the value that you are seeking- the supervision is having the kay being a supervisor of the value
			- **Regression model**- Predicting a continous-valued output like a housing price of a suburb or value of a speicif currency (as these values are constantly changing)
			- **Classification model**- Trying to predict a discrete number of values- like if something is a specific image based on a set of given images (cat, dog, tiger) or if something is something or is-not something (is this email spam)
- **Data**- Using the datasets to be able to recognise patterns within data of integers and being able to label specific data to maybe an image or some sort of visualisation- kind of a key:value tag
	- **Acquiring the data**- can either manually get it and add in relationships and keys to each piece of data- but this is too laborsome. Can observe behaviours and store the data and try make predictions based on previous behaviours. Can download from websiutes/partnerships etc. 
	- **Data problems**- data integrity and missing values can cause problems, need to data clean
- **Terminology**- 
	- **Machine Learning**- Learns the input to output- usually software running a algorithm of machine learning. Gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed (software)
	- **Data Science**- Analyse the data set to come up with the insight to improve businesses decisions. Extracting knowledge and insights from data (power slides)
	- **Deep Learning**- Using the neural networks to take in different sets of data and able to make an output based on each of the input, the neural networks basically checks for many different conditions to be able to provide the best slution- basically one complex and large mathetmatical equation
- **AI in a company**- Using strategic data acquisition and data warehouses to be able to store all their data and make decision based on it.
	- **AI  Transformation for a company**-
		1. Execute pilot projects to gain momentum
		2. Build an in-housr AI team
		3. Provide broad AI training
		4. Develop and AI strategy
		5. INternal and external communcation
- **Deep learning**- taking in all the factors that the person is using to try find the answer and being able to compare them to find the best answer, when comparing large scale data variables against each other to find the answer--- from the input its finding the best way to find the most efficient ouput
	- **neural networks**- are kind of like nodes tha have a specific value that can be combined from previous nodes and previous etc unbtil they find the value for the output
