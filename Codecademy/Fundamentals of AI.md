## Data Literacy
- **Garbage in, garbage out**- answers to data can be only as good as the data that its working on- a lot of data is misrepresented by the analysis of it- is there enough sufficient data and can we get an exact answer to the question from this data
- **Participation Bias**- if the data is not fully refelctive of what the question is then the bias can take effect and not provide the full result to whatever the question is 
- **Variables** - when measuring variables in a specific scenario- **numberical** variables are measured and **categorical** are categorized
	- **Numerical**- Combination of the measurement and the uni-- need what you are measuring and how many of it is the measurement
	- **Categorical**- Describe characteristics with words or relative values
		- **Nominal**- A named value
		- **Dichotomous**- only 2 logical possiblities (yes/no)
		- **Ordinal**- some sort of scale where there are multiple possibilties of choice
- Important to look out for any **missing data** as this can impact the results that you're looking for within the data set, it's not completely necessary to remove it but as long as it's taken into account when making the analysis of it
- **Accuracy**- need to make sure the dataset that you are using to train the model accurately describes the world
	- **Standardization**- having a set guidleines that the data collecting must adhere by to ensure that the data isn't inconsistent with other data
	- IMportant to think critically about the data and spot any common sense inaccuracies that may be a reason for outliers. Think about how any error could have crept in during the data collection process and this can uncover systematic inconsistencies. Identifying possible ways that duplicate data could have been created
- **Validity**- Making sure that the data actually measures what is set out to measure
	- Understanding that the specific variables used to make the measurements of the data actually reflect the answer that you are trying to find
- **Sample representation**- cant test everything, so having a diverse sample size which can be representative of the most key features of the data needs to be used 
## Statistical Thinking
- **Summary statistics**- Measuring and summarising the variables in a dataset
- **Categorical Thinking**- Storing qualitative variables into categories that can tell us more about it when we dont have numbers to
	- **frequency**- the count of how many times a certain variable is there (guitarist= 3, pianits=2, vocal=8)
	- **proportion**- the frequency divided by the total number of that category- total = 3+2+8=13 (guitarist = 3 / 13, pianist=2/13, vocal=8/13)
	- **percentage**- proportion converted from decimal to percent- proportion X 100
- **Distribution**- funcionality that shows how frequently each value occurs within all possible values of that variable
	- **Normal distribution**- typicall known as the bell-curve where an average will be in the middle indicated by larger frequency of that value occuring compared to the lower/higher ends where there's less values occuring
	- TO find more explicit results, use **mean** (average) and **standard deviation** (the spread of results)
	- **SKewed distribution**- having the graph being asymmetrical where one side has more frequency than the other- if more on right it is positively skewed and left is negative skewed (when the tail is on that side)
	- **Median or IQR**- Finding the value that represents the actual value when the data is skewed
		- **Median** the middle value from a data set when the data is arranged in a sequential order (smallest to largest), its the middle (50th percentil or second quartile (Q2))
		- **Interquartile range (IQR)**- a quartile is a marker for a quarter of the data- first quartile (25%), second quartile (50%) and thid quartile is (75%). **IQR** is the difference between Q3 and Q1 (Q3-Q1) which marks the range for the middle of data
	- **Outliers and Robust measures**- larger numbers that skew the data, these are outliers because there are very few of them and their inclusion changes the mean drastically, so mean isn't the best representation when there are outliers than can heavily skew the data
		- Median and IQR are not heavily influenced by extreme values so that means they are **robust** which means they are a better choice to measure the center and spread of a distribution that is skewed or has outliers.
	- **Aggregate data**- This is the mode, which is the frequency of the data- how often a value occurs within the data set. This can show where there is a high frequency of a data which can be representation of a certain occurences, when there are multiple modes this means the analaysis is *bimodal* 
	- **Variable Relationships**- Analyzing a relationship between two numeric values
		- **Scatter plot**- being able to see the representation of any sort of correlation between two numeric values on the x and y axis
		- **Correlation**- when the dots are formed closer together in a sort of group, it forms a line which means there is a stronger correlation which = there is more significance in the impact of what you're trying to measure
		- **Correlation coefficient**- on a scale of -1 to +1 and this tells two things
			- **Direction**-  
				- If positive then it's a positive coefficient meaning that higher values in one are associated with higher values in the other.
				- If negative then it's a negative coefficient meaning that there is a higher value that are associated with lower values in the other/
			- **Strength**-
				- The farther the coefficient is from 0, the stronger the relationship and the more points in the a scatter plot that look like a line
				- If it's closer to the whole number 1 then it feels 'stronger relationship' if its closer to 0 then it's 'weaker relationship'
			- Examples: 
				- 0.74 = a positive and moderately strong relationship
				- -0.12= a negative and weak relationship
				- -0.83 = a negative and strong relationship
## Data Visualizations
Numerous steps in converting data into a data visualzation to be able to understand it better and clearer
- **Choose chart type**- Needs to be able to clearly communicate the relationship between data you are trying to represent. COuld be showing a comparsion between categorical or how a continous value can be predicted
- **Amount variables**- need to see how many variables are being compared
	- **Univariate Charts**- Singular variable has one changing variable- best for COUNT or DISTRIBUTION as a form of visualization
		- **Bar graph**- Good for COUNT of a variable and can compare the amount between different categories in it X and Y axis
		- **Histogram**- Good showing the normal/skewed distrubution 
		- **Box plot**- can show more of a percentile as well
		- **Map**- could be useful for when you can have an image related topic eg (an amount of cheese sold in parts of italy- have dots on the map for each location)
	- **Bi and Multivariate charts**-
