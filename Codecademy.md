# Fundamentals of AI/ML
## Data Literacy
- **Garbage in, garbage out**- answers to data can be only as good as the data that its working on- a lot of data is misrepresented by the analysis of it- is there enough sufficient data and can we get an exact answer to the question from this data
- **Participation Bias**- if the data is not fully refelctive of what the question is then the bias can take effect and not provide the full result to whatever the question is 
- **Variables** - when measuring variables in a specific scenario- **numberical** variables are measured and **categorical** are categorized
	- **Numerical**- Combination of the measurement and the uni-- need what you are measuring and how many of it is the measurement
	- **Categorical**- Describe characteristics with words or relative values
		- **Nominal**- A named value
		- **Dichotomous**- only 2 logical possiblities (yes/no)
		- **Ordinal**- some sort of scale where there are multiple possibilties of choice
