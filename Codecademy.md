# Fundamentals of AI/ML
## Data Literacy
- **Garbage in, garbage out**- answers to data can be only as good as the data that its working on- a lot of data is misrepresented by the analysis of it- is there enough sufficient data and can we get an exact answer to the question from this data
- **Participation Bias**- if the data is not fully refelctive of what the question is then the bias can take effect and not provide the full result to whatever the question is
