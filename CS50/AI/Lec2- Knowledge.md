- **Knowledge-based agents**- reason by operating on internal represeantiaons of knoweldge, where we have sets of information about something and we can determine some sort of conclusion of things that happened based on the knoweldge given
	- logical reasoning to take information to reach conclusions
- **sentence**- assertion of the world in a knowledge representation language

## Propositional Logic
- statements about the world
- **Propositional symbols**-
	- Implication- a -> b this means that whatever a is can then determine what b is- a implies what b is
	- Biconditional- if and if only if the a <-> b
- **Model**- takes information and applies the truth or false value to if the statement is true or false
- **Knoweldge base**- set of sentences known by a knowledge-based agent that is true and be able to draw conclusions about the rest of the world
- **Entailment**- alpha entails beta which means that whenever sentence alpha is true then sentence beta is true. USe of deduction knowing that the first sentence is true then can make assumption that the second sentence iss also true
- **Inference**- process of deriving new sentences from old sentences
- **Model Checking**- Enumerates through all possible states that the possible model could be in based on the information given
